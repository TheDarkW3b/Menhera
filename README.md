# MenheraChanRoBot

## Intro


A modular telegram Python bot running on python3 with an sqlalchemy database.

Originally a simple group management bot with multiple admin features, it has evolved, becoming extremely modular and 
simple to use.

Can be found on telegram as [Menhera](https://t.me/menherachanRobot).

Menhera and I are moderating a [support group](https://t.me/MenherachanSupport), where you can ask for help setting up your
bot, discover/request new features, report bugs, and stay in the loop whenever a new update is available. Of course
I'll also help when a database schema changes, and some table column needs to be modified/added. Note to maintainers that all schema changes will be found in the commit messages, and its their responsibility to read any new commits.
